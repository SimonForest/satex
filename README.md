Satex
=====

Satex is a [string diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram)
generator for LaTeX. It takes as input a formula such as
```
(1 * delta) * (mu * 1)
```
(appropriately written in the LaTeX file) and produces a diagram such as

![left Frobenius](doc/fig/frobl.svg)

generated using TikZ.

It is inspired from [Catex](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~yves.guiraud/) (see
also the
[documentation](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~yves.guiraud/catex/catex.pdf)) for
which the sources where unfortunately not available.
